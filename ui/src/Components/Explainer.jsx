            Because Cards Against Humanity is fun, and hilarious; but let's face it, play it enough times and
            you start to get bored, because you've seen every answer. Also, Markov chains are absurd, and hilarious.
            So to my way of thinking, they're a perfect combination.

            That said, I have a strange sense of humour;
            so perhaps you won't find this as hilarious. Your loss if you don't. However I really do hope this
            provides you with some manner of amusing distraction from your otherwise dull and dreary life. ENJOY!
