### Why??

Because Cards Against Humanity is fun, and hilarious; but let's face it, play it enough times, and
you get bored, because you've seen every answer. Also, Markov chains are absurd, and hilarious (to my way of thinking, 
they're a perfect combination). 

That said, I have a strange sense of humour; so perhaps you won't find this as hilarious. 
Your loss if you don't, however I really do hope this provides you with some manner of amusing distraction from your 
otherwise dull and dreary life. 

*ENJOY!*
