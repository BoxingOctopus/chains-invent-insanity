### Instructions/Notes:

The markov chain generator will try numerous times to assemble what is meant to pass for a logical sentence. However, 
generally speaking, this value SHOULD be above 1000 to avoid an error. The default value of 10000 should be fine enough, 
but if you start seeing duplicate cards, you may want to increase this number.

Additionally, you can pick the number of cards you'd like to generate.

Once you've generated the cards, you can simply refresh the browser to get a new set of cards using the same parameters, 
or click the "Start Again" button to return to this page.
