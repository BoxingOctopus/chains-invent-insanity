### WTF is a Markov Chain?

Wikipedia has this to say on the subject of Markov Chains:

***
<cite>
    "...a Markov process is a specific type of a mathematical object known as a stochastic or random process,
    which is usually defined as a collection of random variables. Historically, the random variables were
    associated with or indexed by some set of numbers, usually viewed as time, giving the interpretation of
    a stochastic process representing numerical values of some random system evolving over time, such as an
    electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noi..."

Um...no. Just. Just no. I dunno about you, but I kinda lost that at the first "stochastic" (whatever the hell
that means).

So what the **HELL** is a Markov Chain then? The tl;dr version is that a Markov Chain is a predictive algorithm which 
attempts to figure out (using some fancypants statistical hoodoo) how to predict what should come next in a sequence of 
data, based on an already established data set; whether that data is in the form of words, numbers, emojis, animals, 
sasquatches...whatever. 

Still confused? Alright fine. The *SUPER* tl;dr version is that Markov Chains are at the heart of what makes your 
smartphone's autocomplete work (that is, if by "work", you actually **MEANT** to use the word "ducking" all those times...)
